Welcome to my comprehensive Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice repository!
This collection includes my personal solutions, notes, and code snippets for core DSA topics and problem-solving patterns.

🚀 About
Purpose: Strengthen foundational coding and problem-solving skills required for interviews, exams, and competitive programming.

Status: Active – I’m continuously adding new solutions and folders as I learn more!

📂 Structure
Each folder is dedicated to a key DSA concept, featuring relevant problems, explanations, and code in C++ (or your primary language).
